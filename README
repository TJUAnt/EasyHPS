EasyHPS is a multilevel hybrid parallel runtime system for dynamic
programming. EasyHPS system encapsulates details of parallelization
implementation, such as task scheduling and message passing, and
provide easy API for users to reduce the complexity of parallel
programming.

This project is implemented by C/C++, Pthread and MPI. In order to run this
project or use this project, the environment should have the corresponding
compliers and libraries.

This README is just a fast "quick start" document. You can find more details
in the EasyHPS.pdf

It is as simple as:

    % make

We have implemented a dynamic algorithm as a demo -- SmithWaterman General 
Gap. To run this demo, just type:
   
    % ./run.sh
